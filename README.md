# Data Analysis 3: Prediction and Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains the assignment for prediction and introduction to machine learning. In this course I learnt and applied prediction modeling using R. The data and code was provided by professor [Gabor Békés](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies) and it created the foundation of our assignments.

# Course Content:

1. Framework for prediction (prediction error, loss function, RMSE, prediction with regression, overfitting, cross-validation)
2. Model building and selection (process, feature and label engineering, LASSO)
3. Regression trees (CART, stopping rules, pruning, search algorithms, regression vs
CART)
4. Random forest (boosting, decorrelating trees, regression vs random forest) and GBM
5. Probability prediction and classification (threshold selection, ROC/AUC, classification with logit vs. random forest)
6. Forecasting from time series data (serial correlation, cross-validation in time series, ARIMA, vector autoregression)
