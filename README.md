# Data Analysis 3: Prediction and Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains the assignment for prediction and introduction to machine learning. In this course I learnt to perform visualization and extract meaningful data and information from text and other shapes of data such as mp3, png, pdf, excel, csv, etc. It introduced the student to the basics of python programming and manipulation and mining of text. It covered the most commonly used tools for data visualization and information retrieval. We covered the use of regular expressions, cleaning and preparing data and text for use. We then applied basic natural language processing methods and machine learning tools to demonstrate how (text) classification is performed. We also explored methods for sentiment analysis.
